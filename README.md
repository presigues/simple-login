this is a ui design project for how i would design a login / signup page. it is not funcional however it shows for a cool design that would work if it were to become functional

you can click sign up to switch between the login page and sign up page. and you can type in both email and pass. 

overall i hope you enjoy seeing how i would design a cool login / signup page.
